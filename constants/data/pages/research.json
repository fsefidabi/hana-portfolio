As a passionate advocate for inclusivity and digital transformation within the fashion sphere, I immersed myself in the domains of digital fashion and social issues such as diversity, equity, and inclusivity as two of the most widely debated topics in our contemporary world. I explored how emerging techs have the potential to foster social inclusion, diversity, and equity within the fashion system.",
